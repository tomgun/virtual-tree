# Reviewing Code

Systematic code review for quality, correctness, security, and conventions.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Changes

Read the changed files to understand what was modified and why:

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Or if reviewing a PR:
```bash
gh pr diff <number>
```

### Step 2: Review Against Checklist

Check each dimension:

1. **Correctness**: Does the code do what it claims? Edge cases handled?
2. **Security**: Input validation, injection risks, auth checks?
3. **Performance**: Unnecessary loops, N+1 queries, missing caching?
4. **Style**: Follows project conventions? Consistent naming?
5. **Tests**: Are changed paths covered by tests?
6. **Documentation**: Are comments and docs updated?

### Step 3: Report Findings

Present findings organized by severity:
- **Must Fix**: Bugs, security issues, breaking changes
- **Should Fix**: Code quality, missing tests, unclear naming
- **Consider**: Style preferences, optimization opportunities

### Step 4: Suggest Specific Fixes

For each issue, provide:
- What the problem is
- Why it matters
- A concrete fix (code snippet)

## Examples

**Example 1: Reviewing a PR**
User says: "/review PR #42"
Steps taken:
1. Run `gh pr diff 42` to see changes
2. Read modified files for context
3. Found: SQL injection risk in user input handler
4. Report: "Must Fix: Line 45 of api/users.js concatenates user input into SQL query. Use parameterized queries instead."
Result: Actionable review with specific fix suggestions.

**Example 2: Quick code check**
User says: "Is this function okay?"
Steps taken:
1. Read the function and surrounding context
2. Check error handling, edge cases, naming
3. Found: missing null check on optional parameter
Result: "Looks good overall. One issue: `data` parameter could be null — add a guard."

## Troubleshooting

**Too many issues found**
Cause: Large changeset or many quality issues.
Solution: Prioritize by severity. Focus on Must Fix items first. Suggest breaking the review into smaller pieces.
