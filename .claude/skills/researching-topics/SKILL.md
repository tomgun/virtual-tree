# Researching Topics

Web search, documentation lookup, and technology evaluation.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Clarify the Research Question

Understand what information the user needs:
- Specific API documentation?
- Technology comparison?
- Best practices for a technique?
- Bug/error resolution?

### Step 2: Search and Gather

Use web search for current information:
- Official documentation first
- Stack Overflow for common issues
- GitHub issues for library-specific problems
- Blog posts for best practices (prefer recent sources)

### Step 3: Synthesize Findings

Present findings organized by relevance:
- Direct answer to the question
- Supporting evidence and sources
- Trade-offs or alternatives if applicable
- Recommended approach with justification

### Step 4: Save if Valuable

If the research informs a decision, save it:
```
docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md
```

## Examples

**Example 1: Technology evaluation**
User says: "Should we use Redis or Memcached for caching?"
Steps taken:
1. Search for current comparisons and benchmarks
2. Check project's existing infrastructure (STACK.md)
3. Compare: persistence, data structures, clustering, ease of setup
Result: Recommendation with trade-offs table and links to sources.

**Example 2: API documentation lookup**
User says: "How does the Stripe webhook verification work?"
Steps taken:
1. Fetch Stripe's official webhook docs
2. Extract key steps: signature verification, event handling
3. Provide code example matching project's language
Result: Step-by-step guide with code snippet and security notes.

## Troubleshooting

**Outdated information found**
Cause: Search results may include old articles.
Solution: Check publication dates. Prefer official docs. Cross-reference multiple sources.
