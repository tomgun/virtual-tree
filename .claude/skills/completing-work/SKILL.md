# Completing Work

Verify acceptance criteria, mark features done, update specs, and cleanup.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Verify Acceptance Criteria

Read `spec/acceptance/F-XXXX.md` and verify each criterion is met:

1. All criteria have passing tests
2. Documentation is updated
3. No known regressions

If any criteria are not met, list what remains and ask user how to proceed.

### Step 2: Complete WIP Tracking

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/wip.sh complete
```

This removes the `.agentic-state/WIP.md` lock file.

### Step 3: Update Feature Status

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/feature.sh F-XXXX status shipped
```

### Step 4: Update Artifacts

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/journal.sh "F-XXXX Complete" "Implemented [description]" "Next: [what's next]" "None"
bash .agentic/tools/status.sh focus "F-XXXX shipped, ready for next task"
```

### Step 5: Flush Pending Items

Check for any pending tasks captured during implementation:

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/todo.sh list
```

Surface any items that should be addressed before moving on.

## Examples

**Example 1: Completing a feature**
User says: "I think we're done with F-0125"
Steps taken:
1. Read spec/acceptance/F-0125.md — 4 criteria, all verified
2. Run `wip.sh complete` — WIP cleared
3. Run `feature.sh F-0125 status shipped`
4. Update journal and status
5. Check TODO list — 2 follow-up items captured
Result: "F-0125 marked as shipped. 2 TODO items to address: [list]"

**Example 2: Criteria not fully met**
User says: "done"
Steps taken:
1. Read acceptance criteria — 3 of 4 met, missing: edge case test
2. Report: "3 of 4 acceptance criteria met. Missing: edge case test for empty input. Should I write that test, or mark as shipped anyway?"
Result: User decides to add the test first.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: No WIP.md found**
Cause: Work was never formally started or already completed.
Solution: Proceed with status updates. WIP tracking is a guard, not a blocker for completion.

**Error: Feature ID not found in FEATURES.md**
Cause: Feature was implemented without a spec entry.
Solution: Add the feature to spec/FEATURES.md retroactively before marking shipped.
