# Committing Changes

Pre-commit quality gates and branch management with human approval.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Check WIP Status

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/wip.sh check
```

If `.agentic-state/WIP.md` exists, work is still in progress. Complete it first:
```bash
bash .agentic/tools/wip.sh complete
```

**Never commit while WIP.md exists** — it indicates incomplete work.

### Step 2: Branch Check

```bash
git branch --show-current
```

- If on `main` or `master`: **STOP.** Create a feature branch first:
  `git checkout -b feature/description`
- If on feature branch: proceed.
- Only push to main if user explicitly says "push to main directly".

### Step 3: Update Artifacts

Before committing, update the durable artifacts using token-efficient scripts:

```bash
bash .agentic/tools/journal.sh "Topic" "What was done" "Next steps" "Blockers"
bash .agentic/tools/status.sh focus "Current state"
```

**Never edit JOURNAL.md or STATUS.md directly** — always use the scripts.

### Step 4: Quality Gates

Run these checks:
1. Tests pass (run the project's test suite)
2. No untracked files that should be committed (`git status`)
3. No secrets or credentials in staged files
4. Changes are scoped — no unrelated modifications

If the project has a validation script:
```bash
bash tests/validate_framework.sh
```

### Step 5: Show Changes to Human

```bash
git diff --stat
git diff
```

Present a summary of changes. **Never auto-commit.** Wait for human approval.

### Step 6: Commit and PR

After human approves:
1. Stage files: `git add <specific-files>` (not `git add .`)
2. Commit with descriptive message
3. Create PR if on feature branch: `gh pr create --title "..." --body "..."`
4. Bump VERSION (at least patch)
5. Log PR in HUMAN_NEEDED.md for review tracking:
   ```bash
   bash .agentic/tools/blocker.sh add "PR #N: Description" "review" "Details"
   ```

### Step 7: Post-Merge Tagging

After a PR is merged, tag the release:
```bash
git tag v$(cat VERSION) && git push origin v$(cat VERSION)
```

## Examples

**Example 1: Committing a completed feature**
User says: "commit this"
Steps taken:
1. Check WIP — not active, good
2. Branch check — on `feature/dark-mode`, good
3. Update journal and status
4. Run tests — all pass
5. Show `git diff --stat` to user: "3 files changed, 85 insertions"
6. User approves, commit and create PR
Result: PR #42 created, logged in HUMAN_NEEDED.md.

**Example 2: WIP still active**
User says: "let's ship this"
Steps taken:
1. Check WIP — `.agentic-state/WIP.md` exists for F-0125
2. **BLOCK**: "Work is still in progress for F-0125. Complete it first with `wip.sh complete`, or should I mark it complete now?"
Result: User confirms completion, then proceed with commit flow.

## Troubleshooting

**Error: On main branch**
Cause: No feature branch was created before coding.
Solution: Create branch now: `git checkout -b feature/description`. Changes are preserved.

**Error: Tests fail**
Cause: Code has regressions or incomplete implementation.
Solution: Fix failing tests before committing. Do not skip tests.

**Error: WIP.md still exists**
Cause: Feature work not formally completed.
Solution: Run `bash .agentic/tools/wip.sh complete` after verifying all acceptance criteria are met.
