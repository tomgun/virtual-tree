# Writing Specs

Spec-writing workflow with protection levels, NFR integration, and delta tracking.

## Instructions

### Step 1: Identify Scenario and Protection Level

Determine the spec operation and its protection level:

| Scenario | Protection | Rules |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **New Feature** | None | Create FEATURES.md entry + acceptance file + migration |
| **Update Planned/In-Progress** | Low | Update criteria, migration if significant |
| **Evolve Shipped Feature** | **HIGH** | Additive-only, markers, migration mandatory, human approval |
| **Status Update** | Low | Use `feature.sh` script |
| **Audit** | Read-only | Run `check-spec-health.sh` |

### Step 2: Execute Workflow

**For new features:**
1. Find next F-XXXX ID in `spec/FEATURES.md`
2. Read `spec/NFR.md` — identify applicable NFRs
3. Create FEATURES.md entry (Status: planned, Related NFRs)
4. Create `spec/acceptance/F-XXXX.md` from `.agentic/spec/acceptance.template.md`
   - Write `## Behavior` section first (technology-agnostic user goal)
   - Group ACs with priority tags: (P1 — MVP), (P2 — enhanced)
   - Add `**Verify independently**` per AC group
   - Place Tests under `## Verification`
5. Run Clarification Pass (Step 3 below) for features with 3+ ACs
6. Show draft to user for approval
7. `bash .agentic/tools/migration.sh create "Add F-XXXX [Name]"`
8. `bash .agentic/tools/check-spec-health.sh F-XXXX`
9. Handoff: "Run `ag plan F-XXXX` before implementing"

**For status updates:**
```bash
bash .agentic/tools/feature.sh F-XXXX status shipped
```

**For evolving shipped specs (CONTRACT MODIFICATION):**
1. Read current acceptance criteria + linked tests + NFR refs
2. Show current state to user
3. **NEVER** delete existing criteria — additive only
4. Use markers: `[Discovered]`, `[Revised in M-NNN: was "X" now "Y"]`
5. Require justification
6. `bash .agentic/tools/migration.sh create "Evolve F-XXXX: [reason]"`
7. Show changes to user — **human MUST approve**

**For audit:**
```bash
bash .agentic/tools/check-spec-health.sh F-XXXX   # Single feature
bash .agentic/tools/check-spec-health.sh --all     # All features
```

### Step 3: Clarification Pass (after drafting ACs)

For non-trivial features (3+ ACs), scan the acceptance criteria against this taxonomy:

1. **Functional Scope** — Are all user-facing behaviors specified?
2. **Data & Domain Model** — Are entities, relationships, and validation rules clear?
3. **Edge Cases & Failure Handling** — What happens when things go wrong?
4. **Non-Functional Requirements** — Performance, security, accessibility constraints?
5. **Integration & Dependencies** — External systems, APIs, data sources?
6. **Completion Signals** — How do we know it's done? What does "shipped" look like?

For each gap found, ask the user (max 5 questions, multiple-choice with
recommended answer). Record answers as `[Clarified]` markers:
- [ ] **AC-NNN**: [criterion] `[Clarified: user chose option B — offline-first]`

Skip this pass for trivial features (<3 ACs) unless the user requests it.

### Step 4: Validate

After any spec change:
- Feature status in FEATURES.md matches reality
- Acceptance criteria file exists and has required sections
- Migration created for shipped spec changes
- `bash .agentic/tools/check-spec-health.sh F-XXXX` passes

### References

See `references/` for detailed workflows:

- `spec_evolution.md` — how specs evolve during implementation
- `spec_protection.md` — shipped spec contract rules and markers

## Examples

**Example 1: Create new feature spec**
User says: "Let's spec out the caching feature"
Steps: Find next F-XXXX → check NFRs → create FEATURES.md entry + acceptance file → migration → validate → handoff to `ag plan`.

**Example 2: Evolve shipped spec**
User says: "We need to add rate limiting criteria to F-0010"
Steps: Read current spec → show to user → add `[Discovered]` criteria → create migration → user approves.

**Example 3: Mark feature shipped**
User says: "F-0125 is done"
Steps: `bash .agentic/tools/feature.sh F-0125 status shipped` → verify acceptance criteria met.

**Example 4: Audit specs**
User says: "ag spec --check"
Steps: `bash .agentic/tools/check-spec-health.sh --all` → report issues.

## Troubleshooting

**Pre-commit blocks shipped spec change**
Cause: Modified acceptance criteria for a shipped feature without migration.
Solution: `bash .agentic/tools/migration.sh create "Evolve F-XXXX: [reason]"` and include the migration in the commit.

**Pre-commit blocks status downgrade**
Cause: Changed a shipped feature's status back to in_progress.
Solution: This is intentionally blocked. If truly needed, create a migration documenting why.
