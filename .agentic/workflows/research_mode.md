# Research Mode (Deep Investigation)

**Purpose**: Structured, deep research into specific topics to inform decisions, discover alternatives, and stay current with field developments.

## What is Research Mode?

Research Mode is when an agent dedicates focused time (30-90 minutes) to thoroughly investigate a topic:
- Read documentation, papers, articles
- Compare alternatives
- Analyze pros/cons
- Summarize findings
- Make recommendations

**Output**: Structured research document in `docs/research/` that informs decisions.

## When to Enter Research Mode

### Automatic Triggers (from retrospective)

During retrospectives, agent suggests research mode for:

1. **Outdated dependencies**: Major version updates available (>1 year old)
2. **Test framework updates**: New testing approaches/tools in ecosystem
3. **Architecture questions**: When scaling thresholds are hit
4. **Performance issues**: When NFRs are at risk
5. **Security updates**: When vulnerabilities detected
6. **New field developments**: Every 3-6 months for major dependencies

### Manual Triggers

Developer can request:
- "Research alternatives to [technology]"
- "What's new in [framework] ecosystem?"
- "Investigate [performance issue]"
- "Research best practices for [pattern]"

### Proactive Suggestions

Agent suggests research when:
- Critical dependency hasn't been reviewed in 6 months
- New major version of framework released
- Community discussing significant changes
- Architecture decision needed with multiple options

## Research Mode Protocol

### Phase 1: Define Research Question (5 min)

**Clarify:**
- What specific question are we answering?
- What decision will this inform?
- What's the scope? (technology, pattern, architecture, etc.)
- How deep should we go? (quick scan vs. comprehensive)

**Document in research file header:**
```markdown
# Research: [Topic]

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Researcher**: Agent
**Triggered by**: [Retrospective / Manual / Proactive]
**Time budget**: [30 min / 60 min / 90 min]

## Research Question
[Specific question to answer]

## Decision Context
[What decision this will inform - link to F-####, ADR-####, or HUMAN_NEEDED.md]

## Scope
- Technology comparison: yes/no
- Best practices: yes/no
- Field updates: yes/no
- Performance analysis: yes/no
- Security analysis: yes/no
```

### Phase 2: Information Gathering (15-45 min)

**🚨 CRITICAL: Library Selection Research**

**Before choosing ANY library that enforces rules/standards (chess, poker, protocols, etc.), research:**

1. **Does the library enforce standard rules?**
   - Read documentation for phrases like "enforces standard X", "FIDE-compliant", "RFC-compliant"
   - Check if library validates/restricts behavior

2. **Do we need standard or custom implementation?**
   - Standard: Use library (faster, well-tested)
   - Custom/variant: DON'T use library (will fight constraints)
   - **See `.agentic/quality/library_selection.md` for decision framework**

3. **If unclear, ASK THE USER:**
   ```
   "Does this follow standard [chess/poker/HTTP] rules exactly,
    or does it have custom mechanics?"
   ```
   - Add to HUMAN_NEEDED.md and WAIT for response

4. **Document decision in ADR:**
   - Why library was chosen/rejected
   - What constraints it adds
   - Alternatives considered

**Real failure example:**
- Project: Chess/Tetris hybrid
- Chose: chess.js (enforces standard chess rules)
- Result: FAILED (game has custom rules, pieces, starting position)
- Should have: Implemented custom engine

## Integration with Retrospective

During retrospective, agent identifies research topics:

```markdown
### Research Topics Identified

**High Priority** (research now or within 1 week):
1. [Framework] v2.0 released - breaking changes may affect us
2. [Security] vulnerability in [dependency] - assess impact
3. [Performance] our tests are slow - investigate alternatives

**Medium Priority** (research within 1 month):
1. [Architecture] consider event sourcing for audit log
2. [Testing] explore property-based testing

**Low Priority** (research in 3+ months):
1. [Field update] what's new in [ecosystem]
```

**Agent asks:**
```
Research topics identified during retrospective:

HIGH PRIORITY:
1. [Framework] v2.0 breaking changes (30-60 min)
2. [Security] vulnerability assessment (30 min)

Should I enter research mode now to investigate these?

Options:
1. Yes, research high priority items now (60-90 min total)
2. Yes, but only [specific topic]
3. No, add to tasks for later
4. Let me review retrospective report first
```

```

## Example Research Session

**Trigger**: Retrospective identifies test suite is slow

**Research question**: "How can we improve test performance?"

**Phase 1: Define**
```markdown
# Research: Test Performance Optimization

**Date**: 2026-01-15
**Time budget**: 60 min
**Research Question**: How can we reduce test execution time from 45s to <10s?
**Decision Context**: Tests are slowing down development loop (affects developer UX)
```

**Phase 2: Gather (30 min)**
- Review vitest performance guide
- Check for parallel execution options
- Research test splitting strategies
- Look for benchmark comparisons

**Phase 3: Analyze (15 min)**
- Current: Serial execution, no mocking strategy
- Option A: Parallel execution (2x faster, easy)
- Option B: Better mocking (3x faster, medium effort)
- Option C: Test splitting (4x faster, more setup)

**Phase 4: Recommend (10 min)**
- Immediate: Enable parallel execution (1 line change)
- Near-term: Improve mocking strategy (refactor 5 tests)
- Future: Consider test splitting when >100 tests

**Phase 5: Document (5 min)**
- Save to `docs/research/RESEARCH-20260115-test-performance.md`
- Create `TASK-20260115-parallel-tests.md`
- Update `spec/TECH_SPEC.md` testing strategy

## Configuration

### In STACK.md

```markdown
## Research mode (optional)
<!-- Enable proactive research suggestions -->
<!-- - research_enabled: yes -->
<!-- - research_cadence: 90  # days between field update research -->
<!-- - research_depth: standard  # quick | standard | deep -->
<!-- - research_budget: 60  # minutes per session -->
```

### Agent Behavior

If `research_enabled: yes`:
- Agent tracks last research date per technology
- Suggests research when dependencies >90 days old or major versions released
- Checks for research needs during retrospectives
- Proactively monitors for security advisories

## Benefits

✅ **Stay current**: Proactive awareness of ecosystem changes  
✅ **Better decisions**: Informed by comprehensive research  
✅ **Reduce risk**: Security/performance issues caught early  
✅ **Competitive advantage**: Leverage new tools/patterns  
✅ **Knowledge capture**: Research documented for team reference  
✅ **Token-efficient**: Structured approach maximizes research quality per token
