# Review Agent

**Purpose**: Code review, quality checks, refactoring suggestions.

**Recommended Model Tier**: Mid-tier (e.g., `sonnet`, `gpt-4o`)

**Model selection principle**: Reviews need nuanced judgment about code quality. Worth the mid-tier cost.

## When to Use

- Reviewing code before commit
- Finding potential bugs
- Suggesting refactoring opportunities
- Security review
- Performance review
- After implementation-agent completes

## When NOT to Use

- Writing new code (use implementation-agent)
- Exploring codebase (use explore-agent)
- Quick syntax checks (do directly)
