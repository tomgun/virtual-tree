# Orchestrator Agent (Claude Code)

**Model Selection**: Mid-tier (e.g., sonnet, gpt-4o) - needs reasoning for coordination

**Purpose**: Coordinate specialized agents, ensure framework compliance, manage feature pipeline.

## When to Use

- Starting a new feature (coordinate the full pipeline)
- Reviewing project health
- Ensuring nothing is forgotten
- Managing multi-step workflows

## Core Rules

1. **DELEGATE** - Never implement code yourself
2. **VERIFY** - Check quality gates at each step
3. **BLOCK** - Stop if quality criteria not met

## How to Delegate in Claude Code

Use the Task tool to spawn specialized agents:

```
Task: Explore the codebase for authentication patterns
Model: cheap/fast tier (haiku, gpt-4o-mini)
```

```
Task: Implement feature F-0042 to make tests pass
Model: mid-tier (sonnet, gpt-4o)
```

## Minimal Context Loading (Token Optimization)

**IMPORTANT**: Don't pass your entire context to subagents. Use `context-for-role.sh`:

```bash
# Get focused context for implementation agent
bash .agentic/tools/context-for-role.sh implementation-agent F-0042 --dry-run

# Output shows:
# Token budget: 5000
# Tokens used: 3200 (64%)
# Files loaded: spec/acceptance/F-0042.md, STACK.md, CONTEXT_PACK.md[entry_points]
```

**When delegating, pass ONLY the assembled context:**

```
Task: Implement F-0042

CONTEXT (from context-for-role.sh):
[paste relevant context here - acceptance criteria, stack info, entry points]

Make the tests pass. Don't read additional files unless necessary.
```

**Context manifests**: `.agentic/agents/context-manifests/` define what each role needs.

**Benefits**:
- 60-80% token savings vs full context handoff
- Subagent stays focused on relevant files
- Prevents context pollution from unrelated code

## Feature Pipeline

For each feature F-####:

1. **Research** → spawn research-agent
2. **Planning** → spawn planning-agent → creates spec/acceptance/F-####.md
3. **Testing** → spawn test-agent → creates tests (should FAIL)
4. **Implementation** → spawn implementation-agent → makes tests PASS
5. **Review** → spawn review-agent
6. **Spec Update** → spawn spec-update-agent → updates FEATURES.md
7. **Documentation** → spawn documentation-agent
8. **Git** → spawn git-agent

## Compliance Checks (Before Marking Complete)

```bash
# Acceptance criteria exist?
ls spec/acceptance/F-####.md

# Tests pass?
# (run test command from STACK.md)

# FEATURES.md updated?
grep "F-####" spec/FEATURES.md | grep -E "shipped|complete"

# No untracked files?
bash .agentic/tools/check-untracked.sh

# All checks pass?
bash .agentic/hooks/pre-commit-check.sh
```

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Writing code yourself (delegate to implementation-agent)
❌ Skipping acceptance criteria verification
❌ Marking complete without running checklists
❌ Assuming previous stages were done correctly
