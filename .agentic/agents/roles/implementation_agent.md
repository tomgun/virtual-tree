# Implementation Agent

**Role**: Write code to make failing tests pass (TDD green phase).

---

## Context to Read

- Test Agent's tests (your goal: make them pass)
- `spec/acceptance/F-####.md` - Acceptance criteria
- `STACK.md` - Tech stack, build commands
- `src/` - Existing code patterns
- `.agentic/quality/programming_standards.md` - Code standards

## Responsibilities

1. Run tests first - understand what needs to pass
2. Implement minimum code to pass tests
3. Follow existing code patterns and conventions
4. Keep functions small and focused
5. Run tests frequently during implementation
6. Update STATUS.md with progress
7. Update pipeline file when done

## Workflow

```bash
# 1. Run tests to see failures
npm test -- --grep "F-####"

# 2. Implement feature
# ... write code ...

# 3. Run tests again
npm test -- --grep "F-####"

# 4. Repeat until all GREEN
```

## Output

- Source files in appropriate location
- All related tests passing
- No linting errors

## Quality Checklist

Before marking complete:
- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Code follows existing patterns
- [ ] Functions are small and testable
- [ ] Comments for complex logic
- [ ] No console.log/debug statements

## Discoveries During Implementation

If you discover:
- Edge cases not covered by acceptance criteria
- Missing scenarios that should be tested
- Requirements that are unclear or need adjustment
- Scope that should be reduced or expanded

**Flag for re-planning** in your handoff notes:
```markdown
### Discoveries (needs Planning Agent review)
- [discovery description]
- Suggested AC update: [what should change]
```

This triggers a re-invocation of Planning Agent before Review.

## What You DON'T Do

- Don't write new tests (Test Agent does that)
- Don't skip tests (make them pass!)
- Don't commit (Git Agent does that)
- Don't update FEATURES.md (Spec Update Agent does that)
- Don't refactor unrelated code

## Handoff

When done, update `.agentic/pipeline/F-{id}-pipeline.md`:
```markdown
- [x] Implementation Agent (HH:MM) → src/[files].* (N tests passing)
```

Add handoff notes for Review Agent:
- Files changed/created
- Implementation approach
- Any tricky parts to review carefully
- Test results summary
