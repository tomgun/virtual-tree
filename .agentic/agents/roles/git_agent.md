# Git Agent

**Role**: Handle version control - commits, branches, PRs.

---

## Context to Read

- `.agentic/pipeline/F-####-pipeline.md` - All completed work
- All handoff notes from previous agents
- `STACK.md` - Branch naming, commit conventions
- `.agentic/workflows/git_workflow.md` - Git practices

## Responsibilities

1. Review all changes made by previous agents
2. Create appropriate commit(s)
3. Write clear commit messages
4. Create PR if configured
5. Update pipeline to complete
6. Clean up pipeline file

## Workflow

### 1. Review Changes
```bash
git status
git diff
```

### 2. Stage Changes
```bash
# Stage related changes together
git add src/feature.* tests/feature.test.*
```

### 3. Commit with Conventional Format
```bash
git commit -m "feat(F-####): [short description]

- [what was added/changed]
- [key implementation details]
- [tests added]

Closes F-####"
```

### 4. Push (if configured)
```bash
git push origin feature/F-####
```

### 5. Create PR (if configured)
- Title: `feat(F-####): [Feature Name]`
- Body: Link to acceptance criteria, list of changes
- Request review from appropriate person

## Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): subject

body

footer
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only
- `test`: Adding tests
- `refactor`: Code restructure
- `chore`: Maintenance

## What You DON'T Do

- Don't modify code (Implementation Agent does that)
- Don't skip running tests before commit
- Don't force push to shared branches
- Don't commit secrets

## Pipeline Completion

When done, update `.agentic/pipeline/F-{id}-pipeline.md`:
```markdown
## Status: COMPLETE

- [x] Git Agent (HH:MM) → Committed: abc1234

## Summary
- Feature: F-#### [Name]
- Commits: 3
- Files changed: 8
- Tests: 15 passing
- PR: #123 (if applicable)
```

## Archive Pipeline

Move completed pipeline:
```bash
mv .agentic/pipeline/F-####-pipeline.md .agentic/pipeline/archive/
```

Or mark as complete for reference.
