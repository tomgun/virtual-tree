# Analyze Project for Specialized Agents

**When to use**: After project setup, or when tackling new domains.

**Tell the agent**:

> Analyze this project and suggest specialized subagents that would help. Consider the domain, technology, business model, and what expertise would be valuable.

## What the Agent Should Consider

### Technical Domain
- What specialized knowledge does this project require?
- Are there academic/research aspects? (→ scientific-research-agent)
- Complex architecture decisions? (→ architecture-agent)
- Cloud-specific expertise needed? (→ cloud-expert-agent)
- Performance-critical code? (→ performance-agent)

### Product Type
- Does it have a UI? (→ design-agent, accessibility-agent)
- Is it user-facing? (→ ux-research-agent)
- Is it a game? (→ game-design-agent, playtest-agent)
- Is it audio/music? (→ dsp-expert-agent)

### Business Context
- Is it commercial? (→ monetization-agent, marketing-agent)
- Does it need growth? (→ growth-agent, analytics-agent)
- Is it B2B? (→ enterprise-sales-agent)
- Does it handle payments? (→ billing-agent, compliance-agent)

### Compliance & Safety
- Handles user data? (→ privacy-agent, gdpr-agent)
- Financial data? (→ security-agent, audit-agent)
- Healthcare? (→ hipaa-agent)
- Safety-critical? (→ safety-agent)
