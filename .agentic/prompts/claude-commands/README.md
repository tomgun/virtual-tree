# Claude Custom Commands (Optional)

**For Claude Code users only** - Set up slash commands for common workflows.

**Requirements**: Claude Code with custom commands enabled (check Claude settings)

---

## What Are Custom Commands?

Custom commands let you type `/command` in Claude to quickly invoke predefined workflows. They're like shortcuts for our ready-to-use prompts.

**Example**: Type `/start` to load context from STATUS.md and begin working

---

## Setup

### Method 1: Claude Code Settings (if supported)

1. Open Claude Code settings
2. Go to "Custom Commands" or "Slash Commands"
3. Add commands from this directory
4. Save and restart Claude

### Method 2: Manual (copy-paste prompts)

If your Claude version doesn't support custom commands:
- Just use the regular prompts from `.agentic/prompts/claude/`
- Copy and paste them when needed
- Same functionality, just manual

---

## Available Commands

| Command | Description | Prompt File |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| `/start` | Start session with context loading from STATUS.md | `start.md` |
| `/continue` | Resume from STATUS.md and WIP.md (deprecated, use /start) | `continue.md` |
| `/verify` | **Run verification gates** (quality check) | `verify.md` |
| `/implement` | Implement a feature (TDD mode) | `implement.md` |
| `/test` | Write tests for a feature | `test.md` |
| `/fix` | Fix linter/test errors | `fix.md` |
| `/quality` | Run quality checks | `quality.md` |
| `/retro` | Run project retrospective | `retro.md` |
| `/research` | Deep research on topic | `research.md` |
| `/end` | End session with documentation | `end.md` |

## How You Help the Framework

**The framework works best when you actively participate.** Here's how:

### Run `/verify` at Key Moments

The agent should run doctor.sh automatically, but you can ensure quality by asking:

| When | Say |
|------|-----|
| Before starting work | `/verify` or "run doctor" |
| After completing a feature | `/verify` |
| Before committing | `/verify` or "check before commit" |
| Something feels off | `/verify` |

### Prompt the Agent

If the agent seems to be skipping steps, you can say:
- "Did you check the acceptance criteria?"
- "Run doctor.sh before we continue"
- "What does verification say?"
- "Are we following the framework guidelines?"

### The Partnership

You and the agent work together:
- **Agent**: Follows guidelines, runs tools, updates docs
- **You**: Verify quality, make decisions, catch drift

**This is human-agent collaboration** - neither works perfectly alone, but together you maintain quality.

## Command Files

Each `.md` file in this directory is a command prompt. The format is:

```markdown
---
command: /commandname
description: What this command does
---

[Prompt text that Claude will process]
```

---

## Usage Examples

**Start a session**:
```
/start
```
Claude will load context and present session options.

**Resume work**:
```
/start
```
Claude will read STATUS.md and WIP.md to resume.

**Implement feature**:
```
/implement F-0010
```
Claude will start TDD workflow for F-0010.

**Run retrospective**:
```
/retro
```
Claude will conduct project health check.

---

## Customization

You can modify these commands or add your own:

1. Copy a command file
2. Modify the prompt text
3. Change the command name
4. Add to Claude Code settings

**Example custom command**:
```markdown
---
command: /deploy
description: Deploy to production
---

I want to deploy to production. Please:

1. Check that all tests pass
2. Verify quality checks pass
3. Check that FEATURES.md is up-to-date
4. Review CHANGELOG.md
5. Confirm deployment checklist
6. Guide me through deployment process

Then await my confirmation before proceeding.
```

## Why Optional?

- **Not all Claude versions support custom commands**
- **Copy-paste prompts work just as well**
- **Cursor/Copilot users**: Use prompts from `.agentic/prompts/cursor/` instead
- **Flexibility**: Some users prefer explicit prompts over slash commands
